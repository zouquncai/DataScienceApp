    "    \n",
    "    - We can define AI as computer behavior that mimics human decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Most people may associate AI with some sort of futuristic-looking robots or a machine dominated world. \n",
    "    It might sound daunting or too distant from our everyday lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - AI can actually be as simple as a bunch of if-else statements to decide what to wear today. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Smart speakers like Siri and Alexa are some examples of AI in our everyday lives.\n",
