### Data Scientists extract meaning from data. They help us understand the world and discover new things.

The term data scientist was coined as recently as 2008, when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data. 

Data scientists work with large amounts of data every day. From the data, they find patterns and trends with the help of various tools. These patterns and trends can help individuals or businesses make data-driven decisions. The most important skills for a data scientist is math and computer skills; in addition, successful data scientists often are domain experts who are well versed in the business they are in. Below are the key tasks they often find themselves deal with on a daily basis:

- *Collect and clean data*: they gather information from various sources, like websites, surveys, or databases; and make sure the data is accurate. 
- *Exploratory data analysis*: they apply mathematical tools to find patterns and relationships within the data. 
- *Build models*: they can create computer programs to predict future outcomes based on the data. 
- *Communicate findings*: they explain their results to others in a clear way so companies can use the information to make better choices.

In the next few chapters, we are going to use the sample dataset **cars2020** to demonstrate some of the tasks that a data scientist would tackle. This dataset is an example of structured data which captures the fuel efficiency (i.e., MPG) for different vehicle models. The goal is to understand the relationship between fuel efficiency and type of car (including the various features of a car, such as 2-wheel or 4-wheel drive).
