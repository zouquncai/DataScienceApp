    Now let's start with **Exploratory Data Analysis**. It is the process for analyzing data sets to identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies. A data scientist uses many tools to help understand the data, including:
    - check the distributions of each variable in the data
    - create charts (such as bar chart, line chart) to help visualize the data
    - analyze the correlations between variables in the data
    - build models to mathematically evaluate the patterns in the data
